## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a client by URL or by object.

```bnl
‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ï conn = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  user: "root",
  password: "",
  database: "myapp",
  port: 3306,
  ssl: false,
  debug: true
});
```
---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bnl
"use strict";

‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ï conn = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  user: "root",
  password: "",
  database: "myapp",
  port: 3306,
  ssl: false,
  debug: true
});

‡¶Ö‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶≤‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶´‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶∂‡¶® main(){
  ‡¶ö‡ßá‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ{
    ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ conn.connect();
    ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ï result = ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ conn.query("SELECT * FROM users");
    console.log('Users:', result);
  }‡¶ß‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶®(err){
    console.error("Connection error: ", err);
  }‡¶Ö‡¶¨‡¶∂‡ßá‡¶∑‡ßá{
    ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶æ conn.end();
  }
}
main();
```

## üîê Parameterized Queries

Always pass values separately to prevent SQL injection:

```bnl
const user = await db.query(
  "SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = ?",
  ["alice@example.com"]
);
```

- `?` placeholders are replaced safely with encoded values.
- For IN-lists, pass arrays and use helpers:

```bnl
const ids = [1,2,3];
const rows = await db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id IN (?)", [ids]);
```
